## W3 Pair Plan
- Fix Jupyter notebooks not showing up
- Complete as much of the missing W0/W1/W2 JS/Python/Bash implementations as I can
- Organise my VSCode instance and Github Pages blog so all the dates are actually correct, file syntax/names are standardised, and I can actually find everything in the site.
- Experiment with JS implementation and making functional code in the Github Pages site as a pair.
