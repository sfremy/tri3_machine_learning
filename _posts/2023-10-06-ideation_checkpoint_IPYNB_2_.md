# Movie Database Project Plan

## Introduction
We are excited to present our plan for creating a comprehensive movie database. Our team is composed of 4 people.  

- Scrum Master: Nandan
- Backend Developer and Deployment Specialist: Torin
- DevOps Engineers: Remy and Arnav

## Project Goals
Our primary goal is to create a user-friendly movie database that provides detailed information about movies, including cast, crew, ratings, and more. We aim to incorporate data from the OMDB (Open Movie Database) API to enrich our database with extensive movie information.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Project Initiation
- Define project scope, objectives, and requirements.
- Set up communication channels and project management tools.
- Appoint roles and responsibilities within the team.
- Create a scrum board that helps us know what to complete and what to do 

### Phase 2: Data Integration
- Utilize the OMDB API to retrieve movie data, including titles, release dates, cast, crew, and ratings.
- Develop scripts and tools to automate data retrieval and updates.
- Ensure data consistency and accuracy.

### Phase 3: Backend Development
- Torin will lead the development of the backend system.
- Design and implement the database schema for storing movie data.
- Implement user authentication and authorization for access control.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development
- Collaborate with the backend team to integrate the API into the frontend.
- Design an intuitive and responsive user interface for the movie database.
- Implement search and filter functionality for users to explore movies.

### Phase 5: DevOps and Deployment
- Remy and Arnav will handle the deployment and DevOps aspects of the project.
- Set up a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Deploy the application on a scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct thorough testing of the application, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Identify and resolve any issues or bugs.
- Ensure data integrity and security.

### Phase 7: Documentation and Training
- Create comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
- Provide training materials for using and maintaining the movie database.
- Document API endpoints and usage.

### Phase 8: Launch and Maintenance
- Launch the movie database to the website.
- Monitor system performance and user feedback.

## Summary
With Nandan as our Scrum Master, Torin leading backend development and deployment, and Remy and Arnav handling DevOps, we are confident in our team's ability to create a top-notch movie database. Our incorporation of data from OMDB will make our database a valuable resource for movie enthusiasts. We look forward to bringing this project to fruition and delivering a fantastic user experience.
