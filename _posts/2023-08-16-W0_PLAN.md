## W0 Retrospective
<p>Setup and planning during W0 was inhbited by a variety of factors, namely unfamiliarity with the course requirements and lack of instruction. As a result, this retrospective plan has been constructed from my understanding of the requirements as of 9/1/2023 and review of the W0 material on Canvas.
</p>

## W0 Plan (Approximate)
- Set up the GitHub Pages website host
- Install all necessary peripherals
- Acquire all necessary materials
- Gain an understanding of how to use Markdown and the HTML/CSS system

<p>Day-to-day plans are missing from these sections as they have been constructed retroactively.
