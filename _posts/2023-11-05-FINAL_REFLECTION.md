# Trimester 1 Group Project ('NART Movies') Contributions

<p>My contribution to the group project was somewhat limited this trimester. Since backend API work was claimed mainly by Torin and Nandan and there wasn't much room for additional work there, I was primarily restricted to frontend development for the project. However, I did accomplish several critical tasks within the frontend space.</p>

<p>I made a total of 47 commits over the course of the development of the NART-Movies front page. These included 1163 additions and 695 deletions.</p>

- Majority of present frontpage save titles and navbar was made by me
- Scrolling behavior, styles, background, etc. but these are mostly CSS so I won't cover them

- Similar applications to the other areas of the site, but these are also relatively small contributions

- Primarily responsible for pushing the rec system in the original design
- This here is an early draft of the HTML scripting

- First draft of rec system shown here was mine, but the final version was contributed to by all members of the team

### College Board Quiz Notes
- Q6: The Internet Engineering Task Force is a volunteer organization dedicated to developing standards and protocols for internet communication.
- Q23: This is asking for present redundancy or lack therof. (B) has only one route between devices P and S so it is the correct answer.
- Q41: (B) adjustedTotal <- Max(midtermExam, finalExam) + finalExam
- Q43: (A) The algorithm runs in reasonable time (n^2 computation steps with n inputs)
- Q45: P AND Q -> True when both are true only \| NOT(P AND Q) -> False when both are true only. (C)
- Q46: Here 'undecidable' refers to unsolvable, so it is not possible to solve the problem for all programs and inputs (D).

# Reflective Summary

### Learnings
- I learned how to use JS at a non-trivial level
- I familiarized myself with the concepts of APIs and web data storage despite not working with
- I learned how to use ChatGPT as a coding tool
- I familiarized myself with web design overall and the HTML/CSS system

### Improvements
- I let other responsibilities take away from my work time signficantly and so I didn't perform as well as I could have
- No reason for staying out of backend (I only crashed the server once), and I could probably have made more contributions in Python backend
- Application of personal skills was insufficiently beneficial for the team (Do more Python)
- Navigation of the personal blog was made difficult by the lack of a coherent organizational system
- Team recording of plans largely supplanted individual plan recordings by Unit 3 but I should have kept at it

### Goals for T2/T3
- Actually learn JS applicability (I know how to do things in JS but not what things can be done)
- Familiarize myself with ChatGPT coding applications while retaining independence from the tool
- Force myself into Python backend no matter what
