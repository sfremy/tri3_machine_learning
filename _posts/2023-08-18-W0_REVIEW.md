title: Week 0 Summary
description: A reconstruction of the results for my Week 0 work.
type: tangibles

## Description
<p>Week 0 and 1 were compromised due to a failure to understand the requirements of the class and a lack of guidance. I have attempted to reconstruct tangible results here.
</p>

## Results
- Localhost server successfully set up.
- Ruby, Python 3, VSCode, Brew peripherals successfully installed.
- Failed to set up GitHub Pages due to forking the student repository instead of cloning it wholly.
- Incompatibility issues caused by Anaconda exist also but have not been encountered, thus the server functions.
