## W1 Retrospective
<p>Setup and planning during W1 was inhbited by a variety of factors, namely unfamiliarity with the course requirements and lack of instruction. As a result, this retrospective plan has been constructed from my understanding of the requirements as of 9/1/2023 and review of the W0 material on Canvas.
</p>

## W1 Plan (Approximate)
- Resolve issues with theme and formatting of certain modules
- Recover my command list
- Try to learn Markdown

<p>Day-to-day plans are missing from these sections as they have been constructed retroactively.
