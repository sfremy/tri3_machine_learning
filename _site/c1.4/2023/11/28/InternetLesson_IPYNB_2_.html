<ul>
  <li>A catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack.</li>
  <li>ARPANET was created in 1969 and provided the foundation for what came to be known as the Internet</li>
  <li>January 1, 1983 is the official birthday of the modern internet</li>

<h2 id="osi-model">OSI Model</h2>

<p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. Each layer in the OSI model performs specific functions, and together they facilitate communication between different systems. Here’s a brief overview of what each layer does:</p>

<p><strong>1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manages the physical connection and transmission of raw data bits.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensures reliable communication over a physical layer, handling framing and addressing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Focuses on logical addressing and routing data between different networks.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Manages end-to-end communication, ensuring reliable and ordered data delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="osi-model-in-a-network">OSI Model in a network</h2>

<p><strong>1. Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong>
<br /><img src="https://www.ad-net.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Layer-1-1.jpg" alt="Layer 1" /></p>

<p>Layer 1 is how devices transmit information to each other (ethernet, network adaptors)</p>

<p>When we send information, we send it “physically” hence the name physical layer</p>

<p><strong>2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong></p>

<p>When we send information, we send it in binary, frames are the units of binary data, they are the information we send from one device to another (in the same network network)</p>

<p>For example, if i want to send the message “Hello” to my brother on the same network, the frame will be sent within the network to the corresponding MAC address(Media Access Control) address, sometimes referred to as a hardware or physical address, is a unique, 12-character alphanumeric attribute that is used to identify individual electronic devices on a network.</p>

<p>Frames can only be sent on the same network</p>

<p>A switch is a fundamental networking device that operates at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model. Its primary function is to connect devices within the same local area network (LAN) and facilitate communication between them. Here’s how switches work and why they are crucial in network setups:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.howtonetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/17.png" alt="Layer 2" /></p>

<p><strong>3. Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://conceptdraw.com/a886c3/p1/preview/640/pict--network-diagram-wireless-router-network-diagram.png--diagram-flowchart-example.png" alt="Layer 3" /></p>

<p>If I wanted to play Valorant with a friend, I would need to connect to the WiFi, why?</p>

<p>Unlike frames, my friend is not on the same network as me, which means MAC Addresses aren’t enough to locate the device so they cannot communicate with eachother</p>

<p>So we need to identify Hanlun Li on a specific network, how do we do that? IP addresses</p>

<p>IP Addresses are supposedly a unique identifier for each device on the network, to access a seperate device on the network, we must give a destination IP address.</p>

<p>Packets are basically just frames, but with an IP address included in them</p>

<p><strong>4. Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong>
<br /><img src="https://intronetworks.cs.luc.edu/1/html/_images/tcp_ladder_states.png" alt="Layer 4" />
<img src="https://www.colocationamerica.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/udp-tcp.jpg" alt="Layer 4" /></p>

<p>Layer 4 has two protocols UDP and TCP, you can think of it as UDP you just spam packets to the other network without acknowledgement whereas TCP you need to acknowledge everything sent to the other network.</p>

<p>In other words, TCP is slower but more reliable, while UDP is faster but less reliable</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>If I’m sending an important email to my boss, I would use TCP because I wouldn’t want the data to be corrupted or lost.</p>

<p>But, If I’m playing a FPS game, I would use UDP because I need speed to load in whats happening within the game</p>

<p><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7)</strong>
The Application Layer is the topmost layer in the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. The Application Layer (Layer 7) is the layer closest to end-users and provides network services directly to applications.</p>
