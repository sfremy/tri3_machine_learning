<h2 id="example-1-the-internet">Example 1: The internet</h2>
<p>The internet was originally created for scientists to easily share information remotely without needing to send or receive mail from one another. Nowadays, many people use the internet more than they sleep, as the internet has become an integral part of our lives in many ways. Think about how often you use social media, or do school assignments online, or send a simple email. Our use of the internet can cultivate dopamine feedback loops, such as when your crush likes your post on instagram, you get a snap back from that cute girl, or you find a funny TikTok that makes you laugh hysterically. These make us want to seek out these feelings more and more and experience those seconds of happiness. These effects of the internet lead to people having major issues like sleep deprivation, depression, and anxiety.</p>

<h2 id="homework-hack-come-up-with-a-program-with-a-beneficial-and-harmful-effects-you-dont-have-to-code-it-but-your-ideas-has-to-be-detailed-and-organized">Homework Hack: Come up with a Program with a beneficial and harmful effects. (You don’t have to code it, but your ideas has to be detailed and organized)</h2>

<p>Program: An economic optimizer algorithm intended to ensure total sustainability for a country and its constituency. Such an apparatus would fully automatically delegate labor and resources to civic uses in order to ensure maximum quality of life for all members of its creator’s society. While such large-scale automation is not currently possible, increasing complexity of neural networks and increasing predictive capability of physical models may make steps toward it feasible in the next several decades.</p>

<p>Benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reliance on work as a means of survival is eliminated.</li>
  <li>Humans will have generally more free time to dedicate to artistic or scientific pursuits.</li>
  <li>Optimal solutions will be found to most practical civic issues without the possibility of human error or corruption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Problems:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The needs of the majority may result in diminished quality of life for minority elements if resources are limited (though this depends on how the algorithm behaves).</li>
  <li>Systemically biased or corrupted datasets may result in inappropriate behavior.</li>
  <li>A society dependent on robust automation is likely to unlearn maintenance skills and subsequently collapse when the systems break down after inevitable degradation over long timescales.</li>
</ul>
